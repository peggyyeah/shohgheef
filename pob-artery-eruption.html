I watch many videos that have a lot of great content in them. One drawback of videos is they are to find specific information on.

Poured myself a cup of French Roast, followed by another to fight the yawns. Opened up the blinds of my one-bedroom apartment to look out upon the town, oddly still in the early hours of the day. Then, popped on the local morning news while I opened my laptop to check the headlines on Reddit and munch on some toast.

A common man has no hope to be able to ascend to a position of command unless he somehow becomes landed or is extremely potent with command. Most of the Agathian regulars are ill-equipped, having bought their own equipment for the most part.

The pattering of my footsteps echoed out in all directions. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it was going to burst out of my chest. I skidded around the corner and backed myself against the cobblestone wall. It was cool against my back. The thin robe I was wearing was soaked through with sweat, but I could see my breath. Dear Reddit, I don't know where to start.

Only in the past 50 years have we forgotten our medicinal "roots" in favor of patent medicines.
