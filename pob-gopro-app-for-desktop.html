Has anyone tried out the GoPro app for desktop yet? It says it makes organizing your photos and videos easy, which is very appealing to me. I do not use GoPro Studio, but I will probably try this new app out. I edit with Premiere Pro. I will download it tonight and report back. Just wondering if anyone else has already tried. Oops! Something went wrong on the server. If the problem persists contact the administrator. Hello , Thank you for reaching out. Sorry to hear about the trouble you experienced with Quik. If you do not have it yet, install the latest version.  
amp#x200B; I've had several GoPro's in the past and am no stranger to Quik and Studio. I loved the Quik mobile app when all I used was my Session and I could put the SD Card into my phone create a video right away. amp#x200B; I now have a Hero 7 Black which is quite frankly amazing. The quality of the footage is incredible and I love hypersmooth. (Although inverted videos do not play correctly when played off the GoPro.) amp#x200B; As much as I love the H7B what am I supposed. Last week, GoPro released a new piece of software called “GoPro App for Desktop”. It’s a lot like the GoPro app for iPhone and Android, but it’s for your desktop–PC or Mac. It’s kinda handy, but there GoPro Support Hub Find a solution. Share a solution. Ask a question. Stay stoked.

GoPro Studio позволяет импортировать, воспроизведение и редактировать GoPro фотографий This is probably not news to anyone who frequents this sub, but man, the GoPro Quik desktop app is just hot garbage - it freezes and crashed constantly . I've played with other apps (esp. iMovie on my Mac) and it's great that there are bigger / more complex/powerful alternative apps available, but why does GoPro even bother releasing this app when it doesn't work? It's also worth noting that I really LOVE the concept - I want an app to throw together quick, musically-timed videos Download GoPro App. The GoPro App for desktop is the easiest way to offload and enjoy your GoPro photos and videos.

I recently built a Spectator View Pro camera rig (using a GoPro and Elgato USB capture) along with a custom shared experience app to produce the composited spectator view video. Everything worked - BUT, the final combined video output was just "too slow" (many seconds behind the real world). I believe it was because the PC I was using was simply not powerful enough to handle the graphics load. I want to try again for my next project, but wanted to make sure I had the right GoPro Support Hub Find a solution. Share a solution. Ask a question. Stay stoked. Announcements.

So about a month ago I got this camera for my friend for an early Christmas gift and now we've got 2 full memory cards, but no way to get them on the computer. Windows 7 doesn't recognize it. Put the card in my canon and was able to access the photos via usb but not the video Got the gopro for desktop app and it won't recognize it In devices it's saying there are no drivers (CDC driver) installed and I can't find any online. I was able to transfer ten minutes of video in 5 hours using. Quik for desktop is the easiest way to offload and enjoy your GoPro photos and videos.

Hi i recently bought my first gopro, a HB7. I imported all my photos and videos to my Desktop PC using Quick for Desktop, connecting the camera to the pc. Now i want to move all my library to an external HDD (i am going to format my pc), but i am afraid of losing the possibility of keep using Quick for Desktop once I install windows again. So is it possible to move all my library to an HDD and still being able to use Quick for Desktop? And another question related to sd, libraries GoPro (formerly Capture) With the GoPro app, your latest footage moves to your phone and automatically transforms into a QuikStory-an awesome video with effects and music. 1 You can also use the app to control your GoPro, check out your shots and create short clips. 2 Then share your favorite moments to Instagram, Facebook I manage a Tech Dept. for a tv production company where we've owned all of the different GoPro models. We recently began purchasing the Hero7 Black, as well as hiring them from crews who own them. Mostly we check the cameras out to producers who are traveling out to location. We send them out with documentation on how to connect the camera to your phone so you can take control of it. On two occasions now I've had issues where clips go missing. One was on a company owned camera, the other. Hello All: My lovely wife got me a gopro hero 5 for x-mas. However, my shit phone is too old, and the gopro app isn't compatible. I plan on buying a remote instead of upgrading my phone. Will I be able to upload things to the cloud without the app while I'm out (assuming I have a good signal)? Or will I have to wait until I'm home to upload things? Would having the phone app make this any different? I prefer to edit anything on my desktop rather than my phone. If I buy the remote Hello, I bought my first gopro (7 black) and tried to make some first videos before ski season. What got me interested is quik app because I like the idea to be able to create a movie with simple tools, quick and easy. I used programs like vegas pro before but edidting for 2 weeks is just too much trouble for a video that Im gonna share only with my family and friends. amp#x200B; The app on my phone works great. But the desktop one seems to not work as supposed to. I plug the camera 
Today I joined your cult as my X1C6 arrived in the mail. Got a bit of a discount, as I took the risk and picked it up on eBay. At the same time, it dodges some of the potential quality control issues I've seen mentioned in this subreddit - I'm leaving for extended travel in a few weeks and don't have time to play the Lenovo service game if they sent me a lemon. This thing is gorgeous! Haven't seen a Thinkpad in about 15 years, when they were unaffectionately called "stinkpads" by the disappoi. Is this for real? I was using quik on mobile and added my own music without any issue of the software finding good cut/edit points. amp#x200B; Is GoPro seriously limiting the desktop app just to push me to buy gopro plus? Seriously a huge disappointment and major "are you fucking serious?" moment regarding how I feel about GoPro as a company for pulling such a obvious ripoff. amp#x200B; How has the community not pushed back against this terrible decision. Currently thinking about buying a gaming set up that will allow me to play modern titles at a decent fps (60fps+). I am curious as to what others think about my current situation. I don’t think my position is unique but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this – so I thought I’ll ask you clever people. I am mainly a MAC user. I am a hobbyist photographer (raw shooter, lightroom and photoshop with plugins), I occasionally edit 1080p GoPro videos. I work in the medical field Hi, This may sound strange, but I'm trying to stitch my GoPro Fusion spherical (the fisheye) photos on my server writen in Golang. Since GoPro Fusion Studio is a desktop app, so I came down to Hugin and searched for any means to do this task. I don't seem to find the right params scratching my head for days. Can anyone share some knowledge Hi there, this is my first time posting. I really don't know much about tech, so please bear with me. I've googled for solutions and even bought wondershare's recoverit for 80USD to no avail. here goes: I've lost all of my video files for 2 SD Cards:- SD #1 = Sandisk 16GB micro SD card SD #2 = Sandisk 32GB micro SD card amp#x200B; SD#1, I tried to transfer my video to my laptop through the GoPro Quik Desktop App. I synced my GoPro directly with a cable to my laptop. There. I'm not entirely sure what caused this, but I suddenly had a drastic change in performance following a storm/power outage a few months ago. My iMac is plugged into a power surge protector. I turned on the computer and was met immediately with keychain errors. I fixed that issue as far as I'm aware, but since then the computer has been ridiculously slow, applications fail to start or take extremely long, importing photos into Lightroom takes hours - literally 4 or more when it used to take minut. I've got a bunch of dive footage (and stuff from other sports/activities) which I'm working my way through. I'm sure I can't be the only person for whom this could be useful. I do my dive filming using my GoPro. I don't do enough editing to make it worth while learning to use a particularly complicated tool, or to justify spending much over 0 (£70 for us brits). Most of my recent experience has been with the GoPro software. I have in the past used things like the old windows movie maker. 
Hey Everyone, It has been a long time since I've made a post addressing the subreddit ( oh jeez (https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/2s6yt1/announcements_2014_stats_30k_and_new_mods/)), but given all the recent news, updates, pricing changes, release announcements, etc. We just can't highlight all the info in the two stickies that Reddit allows us. So, here's all of the info in one post, plus some commentary from yours truly. I've broken it down by section so you can read exactly. The goal is to create a 360 video where the viewer would be able to move around the filming environment using the desktop nav buttons in the video player, or if viewed through a headset, by looking around. I want to talk about 4 different products sold by a company, so I stick a camera on a tripod, and I stand the same distance away from the camera in 4 different places, each 90 degrees away from the other, so I have myself essentially surrounding the tripod in 4 different places in a perfect. Hello, I have been looking around and trying things myself for the better part of the day to find a way to find my serial number from my GoPro that was stolen last night from my car. It was purchased through amazon who I assumed would have record of the serial number with the invoice to the sale which was incorrect. I had the GoPro hero6 black linked to my iPhone with the GoPro app and to my desktop with the Quik desktop but never to the website itself for updates. I have no pictures 
I read the FAQ, searched the subreddit, and of course googled around. I can't believe there's no easy solution for this. I have a Vuze 3D 360 camera. I can capture 3D 360 videos and watch them on the Rift with a variety of apps and techniques (Facebook Spaces, YouTube+Virtual Desktop, Virtual Desktop and file system, Whirligig, Oculus 360 Video) but I absolutely cannot do the same for photos. I tried all of the above for photos (apart from YouTbe uploading, and using Oculus Photo instead Hey everyone. Looking for some technical assistance. Long story short I got my wife and I GoPro cameras a while back and I believe that I set them both up using my PC orignally. Now, whenever I import footage it is imported to //Pictures/GoPro/DATE/HERO5 Black 2 rather than //Pictures/GoPro/DATE/HERO5 Black. Here's what I've tried in order to correct the issue: Reformatted the MicroSD Tried another MicroSD Hard reset the GoPro Uninstalled/Reinstalled Quik Confirmed what my camera. Hi, sorry if this is a dumb question. I realize this could have been easily avoided. I attempted to transfer a dozen or so video files from my GoPro to my laptop without using any of the GoPro Apps/Software, just plugged the USB into my laptop and cut amp pasted (not copy, not drag and drop.) the files from the GoPro to the desktop. Didn't matter which video player I used; VLC, Windows Media Player etc- I just got a black screen when trying to play any of the clips. Time code stayed
